# tic--tac-toe
Project 17: Tic-Tac-Toe Game  Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic 3x3 grid game for two players who take turns marking X or O. The goal is to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full with no winner, resulting in a draw. It's simple yet strategic and easy to digitize.
